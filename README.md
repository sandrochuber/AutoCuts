# AutoCuts

## Build

1. Clone/Download repo
2. Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/
    -> Enter command line and write 'node'. Executing 'process.versions' should give you a list of libraries and their used versions.
3. Move into the local repo and write 'npm install'. This downloads and installs all needed dependencies into 'node_modules'.
4. Run 'npm run electron-build'. This builds and runs the app in production mode.
5. Run 'npm run electron' to just run the built app without rebuilding it.
